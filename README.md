# Homophones and phonological neighborhoods

Code and data to accompany the paper:

> Trott, S., Bergen, B. (2022) Can a pressure against homophones explain phonological neighborhoods?


## Analysis code

The code to reproduce the final analyses and figures can be found in the notebook, "Comparing baseline models". 

This is also available as a static `.html` page in `Comparing baseline models.html`.

## Data

### Raw data

Raw data files/lexica can be found under `data/raw`. 

### Processed data

Under `data/processed`, each language contains:

- `data/processed/reals`: the processed real lexicon, complete with phonotactic probability estimates.  
- `artificials`: a series of baseline lexica, for each model type (neutral, anti-homophones, anti-homophones+)
